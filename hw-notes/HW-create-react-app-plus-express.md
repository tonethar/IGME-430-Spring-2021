# HW Create React App + Express - Part I


## Overview 

- In this exercise, we are going to see how to:
  - create a React client Application with [`react-react-app`](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
  - connect this app to an [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) server
  - post the completed app to Heroku

## I. Get Started

- For this exercise, we are going to use the Word Associations API:
  - here's the main page - https://wordassociations.net/
  - here's the developer page - https://wordassociations.net/en/api - signup for your free API key now

1) Create a folder named **word-associations** and `cd` into it
