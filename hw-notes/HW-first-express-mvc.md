# HW - First Express MVC

## I. Instructions

1) Start files are here - https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/simple-mvc-views-controllers

2) Watch the video here, follow along by listening and typing in the code. The video is here:

    - [Rich Media 2 - Week 7.1 Simple MVC Controllers - YouTube (46:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JthuX0jkFb0)

3) Make a few small changes to the code:

    - add an `age` field to the `<form>`
    - makes sure that `setName` looks for this parameter, and sends back an error message if it's not set
    - if it is set, go ahead and add an `age` property to the `name` object, and return it
    - you should see something like the following in the web browser after you successfully add a new user (and this will also be visible at the **/getName** endpoint:

```js
{
  "name": "Ace Coder",
  "age": "10"
}
```
