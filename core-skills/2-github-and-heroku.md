# Skill #2  - GitHub and Heroku

## I. Overview

- Let's take one last look at `banjo.rit.edu` before we move on to Heroku
- banjo is a shared Unix server that runs the Apache web server application for us 


- `ssh` to banjo and practice a few basic Unix commands


- In 230/235/330, we used the `banjo.rit.edu` server to post web files (HTML/CSS/JS) and run simple server-side scripts utilizing PHP. Banjo has many other capabilities (via PHP and other languages) that we didn't explore such as the ability to store data on the server via SQLite, generate images via ??? and so on. With our banjo accounts we have been granted some access to the file system
