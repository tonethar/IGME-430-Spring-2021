# 2 - Express - Serving Static Files

## I. Overview
 - Here we will see how to use a built-in express middleware function called "express static" - https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#express.static
 - This can "serve" (i.e. "send") static files for us, so that we don't have to write the file loading and endpoint handing code ourselves
 - Note: a *static* file is one that doesn't change between server calls - examples include images, CSS files, JavaScript files, and some HTML files
 - PS - there's no video for this, and it shouldn't take you too long


## II. Start Files

- The "static" start files that you will be "serving" for this exercise are here --> [client.zip](_files/client.zip):
  - **client/html/home.html**
  - **client/images/dr-evil.jpg**
  - **client/styles/default-styles.css**
