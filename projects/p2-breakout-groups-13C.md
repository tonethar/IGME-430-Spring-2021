# Project 2 Breakout Groups - 13C

## I. Overview

- Today we will put you in Zoom breakout groups consisting of 3 or 4 students, and you will give and receive feedback regarding the *planned features/user experience* of your [Project 2](project-2.md)
- Many of you are working off of/extending your Project 1's - which as I mentioned in class pretty much all were rock-solid on the back-end, but needed some "sizze" on the front-end - so let's brainstorm some exciting new features with our classmates!

<hr>

## II. Instructions

1) See below for the assigned groups - and go ahead and join your designated breakout room

2) Choose one of you to "scribe":
  - this person will record the names of everyone in your breakout room, and the answers to the questions below
  - these answers will be added to a document (DOC or PDF) and posted to the dropbox. Only ONE document per team will be submitted to the dropbox
  - *Note, if you wish, the most efficient approach might be to create a Google Doc and collaboratively edit it. Regardless, the scribe will be responsible for doing the final editing and posting of the document to myCourses.*

3) Below is a template of the document:

```
Scribe Name:

1) Student Name: Ace B. Coder
- Project Name:
- Prototype URL (if it is built off of Project 1)
- Tech "stack" the project will build off of (DomoMaker-E, `create-react-app`, or specify if it's not one of these)
- List at least 2 [User Personas](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html)
  - example: "Rita is an experienced *Magic & Monsters* GM who wants to quickly look up monsters, and save groups of them as "Encounters"
  - example: "Freddy is a newbie *Magic & Monsters* player who wants to be able to suggest ideas for new monsters to the web site"
  - example: "An admin user who will be able to CRUD all of the user submitted data
- Describe at least 3 [user stories](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/user-story/) for the personas that you defined above (three total is fine, you don't have to do 3 *each*)
  - "Title: Submit a monster. Freddy will input the monster details (such as name, description, CR and so on) into a form and click a submit button to send them to the web site"
    - "If Freddy leaves out any of the required information, the form will not submit and will notify him of the missing fields"
- Using the above User Personas & USer Stories as inspiration, list:
  - A) the "must have" features & capabilities of this project 
  - B) the "nice to have" features &  capabilities of this project 
  - C) "stretch goals" for this project (probably to do over the summer)


2) Student Name: Ima G. Student
- etc ...

## III. Breakout Groups

### Breakout Group #1 - Jared Baker & David Chen & Anna Conway & Drew Donovan

- **Jared Baker** - I plan on revamping my project 1, adding react, mongoDb and accounts and building it off the create-react-app:
  - https://jdb3959-430-project-1.herokuapp.com/home 
- **David Chen** - I am going to convert project 1 to using React, Mongo, and logins. In addition, I am going to used Domomaker-E as a "starter":
  - https://dxc7649-430-project-1.herokuapp.com/
- **Anna Conway** - I am going to convert project 1 to using React, Mongo, and logins. I also want to extend the UI and the features as well and will probably use DomoMaker as a launchpad:
  - https://azc5184-430-project-1.herokuapp.com/routines
- **Drew Donovan** - For my project 2 I plan to remake my project 1 using all the fun new stuff we've learned. As of now I see myself starting with Domomaker, but that may change once I begin working on it:
  - https://ddd5189-430-project-1.herokuapp.com/

<hr>

### Breakout Group #2 - Sean Gindhart & Brad Hanel & James Harkins & Breanna Henriquez
- **Sean Gindhart** - For this project, I plan to simply make an upgraded version of my Project 1, which was Infinite Pictionary. I plan to start with a create-react-app script, and then add Mongo, logins, and React to it. If I have the time, I might attempt to add a live online multiplayer aspect to the app, allowing two users to play together simultaneously:
  - https://spg1627-project-1.herokuapp.com/
- **Brad Hanel** - I plan to build off of my project 1 to use React, Mongo, and the ability to log in. I'm going to add the ability to post charts publicly and view public charts if you're a logged in user. I plan to extend off of DomoMaker:
  - https://alignment-charts.herokuapp.com/joke-client.html
- **James Harkins** - For project 2, I am going to make a multiplayer web game out of a pen and paper game my friends and I played in high school. I plan to use MongoDB and HTTP requests for the account making, login, and possibly leaderboards, and then Socket.io for the gameplay. I plan to use create-react-app instead of extending Domomaker:
- **Breanna Henriquez** - I plan to convert my project 1 to using React, Mongo, and logins, and I am going to build off my DomoMaker:
  - https://jeh4253-430-project-1.herokuapp.com/home.html

<hr>

### Breakout Group #3 - Oliver Hindman & Andy Huang Ling & Jacob Kemp-Schneider & Chase Lear
- **Oliver Hindman** - I am going to use DomoMaker E. I haven't come up with what to extend on Domomaker yet but I am planning on it
- **Andy Huang Ling** - I plan on making a chat for people to use. It is just going to be one big chatroom that users would have to register or log in to, to use. I plan on starting from a create-react-app or something similar if I can find something that fits my needs.
- **Jacob Kemp-Schneider** - I plan on converting and extending my project 1, and I am currently planning on building off of the domomaker assignment:
  - https://jmk6152-430-project-1.herokuapp.com/random-char.html
- **Chase Lear** - I think I’m going to study the file upload example and create an app with user accounts that allows people to upload essays, and perhaps use some of what I did in project 1 to add some social media style communication along with it. So people can upload their papers, and then other users might comment on them:
  - https://cal7114-conversation-assistant.herokuapp.com/app

### Breakout Group #4 - Camilo Lima-Castro & Frank Luo & Tom Margosian & Cori Mori
- **Camilo Lima-Castro** - I am going to create a web app for a networked game. For now, I am thinking of centering the app around Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, a slightly more complicated variation of the most famous pen-and-paper game. I am going to extend the DomoMaker assignment and make it fit the purpose of this different real-time app. The plan is to use Socket.io to communicate in WebSockets between the server and the clients, providing real-time updates for the users when competing against their opponents.
- **Frank Luo** - I want to make a simple note taking system that supports people to upload their notes to the site and to log back in later and see what they have uploaded.
- **Tom Margosian** - I’m basically going to be expanding upon my Project 1, creating an app to create lists of restaurants that you’ve been recommended by friends.  It’ll include multiple lists, the ability to share lists with other users, and notes / comments for each place.  My API server is going to be separate from the react node server, and I’m going to be building an iOS app as my final project for my ISTE-454 class as well:
  - TOm will provide link
- **Cori Mori** - I plan on converting project 1 using React, Mongo, and logins using DomoMaker as a base:
  - https://cnm7453-fetch.herokuapp.com/home

### Breakout Group #5 - Alex Parrotto & Lauren Puglise & Jack Richards & Matthew Roberts
- **Alex Parrotto** - I am planning to build a clicker game using React. Users will be able to make accounts and sign in, with their score and powerups being saved to their account. In order to theoretically profit off of the project, it will have a premium membership that users can “purchase” that will double all of their earnings from the clicker game. This will be built off of a create-react-app script.
- **Lauren Puglise** - Cow-a-bug-a! Build off DomoMaker E 
- **Jack Richards** - I plan on using DomoMaker as a base and recreating my project 1, This or That. I want to incorporate user accounts and other new features to make This or That as good as it can be!:
  - https://jjr2098-430-project1.herokuapp.com/
- **Matthew Roberts** - For project 2 I am going to create a free to use workout tracker that shows ads. There will be a premium option that will remove the ads. For the purposes of the project, these ads will be simulated. It will be similar to my project 1, but will use React, Mongo, and logins, and meet the other project 2 requirements:

## IV. Submission
- After class, the scribe should spend a few minutes to clean up the document (edit for clarity/brevity, fix spelling errors, format it so that it's readable etc...)
- The scribe will then post this to the myCourses dropbox before it closes, and will distribute a copy to each member.
