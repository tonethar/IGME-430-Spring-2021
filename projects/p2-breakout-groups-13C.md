# Project 2 Breakout Groups - 13C

## I. Overview

- Today we will put you in Zoom breakout groups consisting of 3 or 4 students, and you will give and receive feedback regarding the *planned features/user experience* of your [Project 2](project-2.md)

<hr>

## II. Instructions

1) See below for the assigned groups - and go ahead and join your designated breakout room

2) Choose one of you to "scribe" - this person will record the names of everyone in your breakout room, and the answers to the questions below. 
These answers will be added to a document (DOC or PDF) and posted to the dropbox. Only ONE document per team will be submitted to the dropbox. *Note, if you wish, the most efficient approach might be to create a Google Doc and collaboratively edit it. Regardless, the scribe will be responsible for doing the final editing and posting of the document to myCourses.*

3) Below is a template of the document:

```
Scribe Name:

1) Student Name:
- Project Name:
- Prototype URL (if it is built off of Project 1)
- Tech "stack" the project will build off of (DomoMaker-E, `create-react-app`, or specify if it's not one of these)
- List at least 2 [User Personas](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html)
  - example: "Rita is an experienced *Magic & Monsters* GM who wants to quickly look up monsters, and save groups of them as "Encounters"
  - example: "Freddy is a newbie *Magic & Monsters* player who wants to be able to suggest ideas for new monsters to the web site"
  - example: "An admin user who will be able to CRUD all of the user submitted data
- Describe at least 3 [user stories](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/user-story/) for the personas that you defined above (three total is fine, you don't have to do 3 *each*)
  - "Title: Submit a monster. Freddy will input the monster details (such as name, description, CR and so on) into a form and click a submit button to send them to the web site"
    - "If Freddy leaves out any of the required information, the form will not submit and will notify him of the missing fields"
- Using the above User Personas & USer Stories as inspiration, list:
  - A) the "must have" features & capabilities of this project 
  - B) the "nice to have" features &  capabilities of this project 
  - C) "stretch goals" for this project (probably to do over the summer)


2) Student Name
- etc ...
```

## IV. Submission
- After class, the scribe should spend a few minutes to clean up the document (edit for clarity/brevity, fix spelling errors, format it so that it's readable etc...)
- The scribe will then post this to the myCourses dropbox before it closes, and will distribute a copy to each member.
