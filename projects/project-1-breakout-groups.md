# Project 1 Breakout Groups

## I. Overview

- Today we will put you in Zoom breakout groups consisting of 3 or 4 students, and you will give and receive feedback regarding the *user experience* [Project 1](project-1.md) prototypes

<hr>

## II. Instructions

1) If you haven't already pushed your most current version of your project to GitHub & Heroku, do so immediately (don't forget to be sure that your code passes `npm test`)

2) Wait to be assigned to a Zoom breakout room

3) Choose one of you to "scribe" - this person will record the names of everyone in your breakout room, and the answers to the questions below. 
These answers will be added to a document (DOC or PDF) and posted to the dropbox. Only ONE document per team will be submitted to the dropbox. *Note, if you wish, the most efficient approach might be to create a Google Doc and collaboratively edit it. Regardless, the scribe will be responsible for doing the final editing and posting of the document to myCourses.*

4) Add the following to the document:

    - the names of each breakout room member, and the link to their working project on Heroku (NOTE: DO NOT SHARE GitHub links)
    - as a group, for each project, discuss how well each project meets or exceeds the [Project 1](project-1.md) requirements, most specifically the **IV. User Experience Requirements**
    - you are likely only going to have 10 minutes or so per project
    - below are the questions you need to answer as a group, and a template you could follow:

```
Scribe: 

Project #1 Author:
Project #1 Heroku Link: 
How is each project meeting the requirements? (discuss as a group):

IV. User Experience Requirements

1) Must provide an engaging and rich user experience

2) Users must be able to add data to the API via POST requests (with limitation). For example, maybe your app is a collection of images and keywords. You might then have a way for the user to add an image url and keywords to your API

3) Users will be able to view API data that others have posted. For example, a list of images and keywords

4) The application must be performant and run as expected. There must not be any hiccups or performance issues when the server is under a light load. Common user errors must be handled gracefully on BOTH the client-side and server-side:
- example: the user forgets to type in their last name (a required form field)
- the client (the HTML page, utilizing JavaScript) will not allow the data to be submitted to the server
- the server will return an error message and a status code of 400 if a value for required field is not given
- we will test the API via the provided <form> AND by using Postman


5) Other
  - Does this app have a purpose/function that is useful for *someone*? 
  - Can you figure out how to use it?
  - Is the visual design pleasing?
  - What area of this project need more attention to make an excellent experience? 

Project #2 Author:
Project #2 Heroku Link: 
etc ...

- If you have time at the end, you can also evaluate the III. Functional Requirements of each project
```



## IV. Submission
- After class, the scribe should spend a few minutes to clean up the document (edit for clarity/brevity, fix spelling errors, format it so that it's readable etc...)
- The scribe will then post this to the myCourses dropbox before it closes, and will distribute a copy to each member.
