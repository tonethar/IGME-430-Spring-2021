## II. Review *Random Jokes Plus* Submissions
- [Homework - Random Jokes Plus](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-430-Spring-2021/blob/main/hw-notes/HW-random-jokes-plus.md)
- If your submission is not perfect, or if there was anything about the assignment that you did not understand, stay around after class and we can look at your code

## III. Building a "Rich" Client
- This is covering how to build the "App" page for Project 1 - non-functional example is here --> https://p1-430-stub-2105.herokuapp.com/app
- Let's use `XHR` to download **/random-joke** and **/random-jokes** and display the results to the user:
  - We saw this in the "Accept Header" demo from last time - but let's peek at that code again
  - You also wrote code to do similar things (with other people's web services) in both 230/235 & 330
  - Here is today's exercise - see dropbox for due date - this will help greatly with Project 1 --> [Random Jokes Plus an Ajax Client](../hw-notes/HW-random-jokes-plus-an-ajax-client.md)

# IV. The rest of the week

- Next time and Friday we'll be working on "Body Parse", which is sending POST data via a form, and adding it to a server "database" 
  - Start code --> https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/body-parse-example
  - Video --> [Rich Media 2 - Week 4.2 POST Requests and Body Parsing (41:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY5sBCg6Ksg&feature=emb_logo)
  - The above video was assigned last week, you need this for project 1, watch it if you haven't yet
