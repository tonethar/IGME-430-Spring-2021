## II. Completed Demo - POSTing Data & Body Parse

- Here is the demo and video (that you should have already watched)
  - Start code --> https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/body-parse-example
  - Video --> [Rich Media 2 - Week 4.2 POST Requests and Body Parsing (41:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY5sBCg6Ksg&feature=emb_logo)
  - The above video was assigned last week, you need this for project 1, watch it if you haven't yet

## III. Here's a different POST demo

### III-A. POST requests & Status Codes
- First, what is a POST request good for? --> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST
- Next, let's talk about some more HTTP status codes
- This is part of your [**HTTP API Study Guide HW**](../hw-notes/api-sg-hw.md)
- We will be returning `200`, `201`, `204` and `400` in today's demo - and you will need to return these in Project 1 as well
- Let's look at what these status codes mean


### III-B. Server demo
- Look for the **POST-DEMO-Start** file in myCourses
- We have a GET endpoint named `/get-users` - nothing new here
- We also have a POST endpoint named `/add-user` - this is all new!
- POSTing data (server-side code):
  - the relevant code is in **index.js** & **jsonResponses.js**
  - we will walk through it together

<hr>

## IV. Send data to the server with Postman
- need to to use the `POST` method
- need to send the data with a `Content-Type` of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

<hr>

## V. Send data to the server with *old-school-post-form.html*

- No JavaScript!
- Works (fairly) well
- `<form>` docs --> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form
- Check out the `action` and `method` attributes, as well as the `<input type="submit">` button - these are unique to forms

<hr>

## VI. Next time

- We will use JavaScript to "Hijack" the form and instead use XHR to send the POST request and values to the server
- We will use JavaScript and regular `<input>` elements plus XHR to send the POST request and values to the server
