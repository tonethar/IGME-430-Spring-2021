## III. [HW - First Express MVC

- [HW - First Express MVC](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-430-Spring-2021/blob/main/hw-notes/HW-first-express-mvc.md)
- There's a lot to talk about regarding this walkthrough/HW assignment

1) New *middleware* (mostly used in future examples):

    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression
    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-favicon
    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser
    - and some middleware we've already seen:
      - http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/serve-static.html
      - http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/body-parser.html

2) Design Patterns
    - *dependency injection* in **router.js**:
      - [here is a good explanation of both *dependency injection* and *inversion of control*](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-intro-to-dependency-injection-what-it-is-and-when-to-use-it-7578c84fa88f/)
    - **router.js** also has all of our `app.get()` and `app.post()` routes defined:
      - but the code that is "controlling" each page is in **controllers/index.js**
      - and as we saw last time, POSTing data is now easy thanks to `body-parser`!
    - MVC:
      - **controllers/index.js** obviously contains the *controller* code
      - **views/** contains the *view* code (HTML in this case) - we will be doing server-side rendering of these pages next week
      - there's no *model* objects yet (soon!)
