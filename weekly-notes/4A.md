# Week 4 Notes (Week of 2/15/21)

## I. Review

- [Project 1 - API Powered App](../projects/project-1.md) - we will talk about this next time
- [Streaming Media HW](../hw-notes/streaming-media-HW.md)
- [Skill #11 - Creating CommonJS Code Modules](../core-skills/11-creating-commonjs-code-modules.md):
  - moved code into multiple modules
  - isn't that *dispatch table* a lot better than a bunch of `if(){}else{..` statements?!
  - but can you think of an even *better way*, so that the developer doesn't have to hard-code every file name?

## IV. HTTP `Accept` Headers
- Our first "full stack" app, with both a JS driven *client* that runs in a web browser, and a Node.js driven *server* !
- The [HTTP `Accept` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept):
  - is a [*request header*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Request_header) (sent by a *client* application such as a web browser)
  - it tells the server which content types the client "understands"
  - the content types are returned in a comma delimited string - we usually turn this into an array to make it easier to work with
  - examples of content types include `text/html`, `image/webp`, `application/json`, `application/xml`, and `image/avif`
  - the server may (or may not, depending on how it is configured/programmed) send back content based on the `Accept` header contents
- How to send custom `Accept` headers:
  - in client-side JavaScript you can use the [`xhr.setRequestHeader()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/setRequestHeader) method of `XHR`:
    - example: `xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept", 'application/json');`
    - IMPORTANT: you must set request headers AFTER calling `xhr.open()`, and BEFORE calling `xhr.send()`
  - you can also use Postman to customize `Accept` and other request headers
