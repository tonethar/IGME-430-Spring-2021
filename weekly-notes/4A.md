# Week 4 Notes (Week of 2/15/21)

## I. Review

- [Project 1 - API Powered App](../projects/project-1.md)
  - Deliverables:
    - **Project 1 Topic** - there is a discussion thread in myCourses that closes at the start of class 5B
    - **Project 1 - API Prototype** - due end of week 5 (see myCourses dropbox for exact due date/time and submission requirements)
    - **Project 1 - API Final** - due end of week 6 (see myCourses dropbox for exact due date/time and submission requirements)
- [Streaming Media HW](../hw-notes/streaming-media-HW.md)
- [Skill #11 - Creating CommonJS Code Modules](../core-skills/11-creating-commonjs-code-modules.md):
  - moved code into multiple modules
  - isn't that *dispatch table* a lot better than a bunch of `if(){}else{..` statements?!
  - but can you think of an even *better way*, so that the developer doesn't have to hard-code every file name?

## IV. HTTP `Accept` Headers
- Our first "full stack" app, with both a JS driven *client* that runs in a web browser, and a Node.js driven *server* !
- The [HTTP `Accept` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept):
  - is a [*request header*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Request_header) (sent by a *client* application such as a web browser)
  - it tells the server which content types the client "understands"
  - the content types are returned in a comma delimited string - we usually turn this into an array to make it easier to work with
  - examples of content types include `text/html`, `image/webp`, `application/json`, `application/xml`, and `image/avif`
  - the server may (or may not, depending on how it is configured/programmed) send back content based on the `Accept` header contents
- How to send custom `Accept` headers:
  - in client-side JavaScript you can use the [`xhr.setRequestHeader()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/setRequestHeader) method of `XHR`:
    - example: `xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept", 'application/json');`
    - IMPORTANT: you must set request headers AFTER calling `xhr.open()`, and BEFORE calling `xhr.send()`
  - you can also use Postman to customize `Accept` and other request headers

- "Done" code is in myCourses

## V. HTTP Status Codes
- Start code --> https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/status-code-example
- Video --> [Rich Media 2 - Week 3.3 Status Codes (38:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHSb7GjmMxA&feature=emb_logo)
- "Done" code is in myCourses
- Reference:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418
  - https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2324.txt
  - https://www.google.com/teapot
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Text_Coffee_Pot_Control_Protocol

## VI. HTTP HEAD requests
- Start code --> https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/head-request-class-example
- Video --> [Rich Media 2 - Week 4.1 HEAD Requests (45:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPkIjyjVHTs&feature=emb_logo)
- "Done" code is in myCourses
- We are NOT having a Zoom meeting on Friday 2/19 - so you need to watch the video linked above in lieu of class:
  - this is an important demo, it shows you how to create some data on the server - in this case it's just a hard-coded `users` variable that will persist until the server reboots

<hr>

## VII. Body Parse 
- Start code --> https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/body-parse-example
- Video --> [Rich Media 2 - Week 4.2 POST Requests and Body Parsing (41:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY5sBCg6Ksg&feature=emb_logo)
- You need this for project 1 - we are covering this week 5
